Varsity has a great impact on our day to day life.It deals with our future as well as emotions,likings,dislikings,refreshment,bondings,maturity,growth
and so on.I have choosen North South University for my higher education as I found it best for me.
I don't know where to start because thinking of writing about it makes me both blissful and gloomy and even confused.Blissful because I am already going to 
finish my first year first semister of university; happy, because I’m glad it’s going to over; and confused because, really,where did the time go?

From the beginning of my varsity life i was too excited with every maters such as environment,teachers,faculties,friends etc.I had a great time throughout 
this semister.I If I want to describe NSU in one word it would be: refreshing.NSU faculties,authorities give me a crystal clear idea about my future and my
capability.It has outstanding and extraordinary faculties.It makes my life disciplined,teaches the values.The amount of work we put in each course is
prominent.

NSU clubs and organizations are one of the best clubs and organizations in this country as well as in the world.It teaches me work ethics,punctuality,
etiqutte and manners,makes me industrious,and most importantly keeps me updated with today's world.As a club member I realized 
every club gives its best to its respective responsibilities and works.

The thing which I would to like mention as the experience of NSI life is the friends I got here.It gives me goosebumps when I recalled those memories 
with them.I know it's just a semister I am going to complete but whatever every day with them becomes memorable.In a short time we become good friends.
And they were and will be my survival kit throughout this NSU life.

Last but not the least NSU gives me the space of doing fun with their activities and makes thoughtful about my future too.I genuinely love my university 
life so far.People are accepting and there are so many things to do.I hope the entire journey of NSU will be worth remembering.
